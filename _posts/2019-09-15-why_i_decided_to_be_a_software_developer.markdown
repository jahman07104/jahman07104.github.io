Why..?

I guess the why is ..why after retiring from a very rewarding carreer as a systems Tech for Verizon ..why would I take on a new carreer as a sotware developer at my advanced age. I guess the answer is because it hits all the marks of what I thought I would do when I retire ..I needed something to do to make money while I can be mobile and self employed and 
also do it from multiple locations . My aim is to be a freelance coder or at least be able to work for a company that would allow me to remote report. In theory I want to be able to work from any location in the world and still do something challenging as well as financially rewarding
