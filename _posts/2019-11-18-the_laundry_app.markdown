This App describes a simple way to track of laundry.User will be able to sign up initialy and on later visits just sign in.
User will also be able to create items to add to a list and then edit the description of that item to update the item or dlete the item from appearing on the list.
Finally the user will be able to log out of the App
I had a lot of difficulty with this assignment. I had a dire situation at home that involved frequent hospital visits  and I could not devote as much time as I would have liked to really study the material and was always trying to catch up. Everyone has challenges in their lives and I will not make any excuses I will just try and do better.
