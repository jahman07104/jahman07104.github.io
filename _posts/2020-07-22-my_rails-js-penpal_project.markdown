The content of your blog post goes here.
   This was a very difficult project for me to complete. I had finished the  previous Rails project in January and passed the assessment when my mom passed away and I could not keep up with the new react courses and concentrate on finishing
and presenting the rails-javascript project for assesment.So I decided to change cohorts and take care of my family issue and I thought I could use the time to learn more about Javascript and perhaps have a better outcome.
Well I have had mixed results in my endeauvors.I ended up sighning up for a lot of free courses and did learn more javascripts courses but they did not really help me prepare for the project as this project has specific requirements that the
courses did not help me with. Another issue with that there was a gap between the time I switched cohorts and in the interim the little skills I had in rails had deteriorated and i now realize I should have spent more time brushing up on those skills. In fact I will have to brush up on all that I have learned on completion of this course .

   My App describes the process of a user being presented with a list of prospective penpals.The user is in this case is male and can then fetch induvidual female penpals with her name, city where she lives and her email address.The user can select and add these penpals or he can return them to the pool induvidually or all at once . Hopefully it meets all the requirements and I can move on to react.
