The content of your blog post goes here.
I wrote my app as an that dispays a daily report of porperties for sale in Jamaica.It displays not only poperty location buts also price and a property description. I thought it would be a clever pun on the scraper method i used to get the info for land in jamaica so I called it Landscraper.
It opens with a welcome to the user and give instructions to the user to navigate the site .Ech screen then dispays the advertised info and has instruvtions to either exit the site or return to the main menu.There are also instructions to view just the addresses and also one to just view a price range.
