The content of your blog post goes here.
I wrote my app as an APP  that displays a daily report of porperties for sale in Jamaica.It displays not only property location buts also price and a property description of induvidual peoperties. I thought it would be a clever pun on the scraper method I used to get the info for properties in jamaica so I called it Landscraper.
It opens with a welcome to the user while providing a list of the daily offerings. the welcome page also  gives instructions to the user on how to navigate the site .Each screen then dispays the advertised info and has instructions to either exit the site or return to the main menu.There are also instructions to view just the addresses and also one to just view  prices and property descriptions.
