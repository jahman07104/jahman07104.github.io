     I am now completing my react-redux project and even though I am happy and relieved, I am 
not entriely content as I almost feel as if I have imposter syndrome. I have heard that I should 
be proud that I made it this far, but I can't shake the feeling that I should know more that I do now
and be able to recall and retain more of what I learned. I accept the fact that most people will not 
remember all the exact syntaxes of all the command line interfaces, but I still feel frustration that I 
dont.
     I have read that the learning actually comes with repetiton and I find comfort in the fact 
that I fully intend to continue with other courses and exercises in software development. Maybe 
as time goes on I will feel that I have a better handle on learning the material  and I will gain more confidence.
This will be my second carreer as I took up software engineering after retiring from Verizon communications
after 32 years. I had thought I was done with learning and was ready to hit the beaches and to travel and enjoy retirement, but got facinated with coding and tried to convince my son to sign up . He, however, showed
no interest and I thought what the heck I'll do it then ..and that was the beginning of my journey
So now as I come to the end of the first stage of that beginning I am excited and also humbled that I have 
so much further to go.# Enter your title hereThe content of your blog post goes here.
