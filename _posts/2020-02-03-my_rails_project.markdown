My rails project describes an Application for a company that deploys Technicains to a customer premise to resolve whatever issues the customer might have. The technician can assign the ticket to himself or it can be assigned to him. The technician can then make a task list that he will use to  complete a list of assignments to comply with the customers wishes. Multiple technicians can be assigned to the same ticket but only the orignator or the ticket can close it.
I come from a communications background having been a Verizon field tech and I have that in mind when I decided to use that model as my project.
I found using devise and generating the models and controllers to be not too bad  to get done but the associations to be very complex and tricky and I needed a lot of help with that part of the project.
I have finally completed the project and I am trying to set up everything for the evaluation
