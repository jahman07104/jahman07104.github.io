My rails project describes an Application that gives donors an opportunity to donate to specific charities . The user will select the charity and be presented with a form to give their  informaiton and donation amount a pop-up form will appear for the donor to inspect  their donation amount and update it as well.The app works with 3 fetches a GET verb to present the charites, a POST verb to submit the form with the donor info, and a  PUT to update the info if so desired. The necessary CRUD actions are also there to accomplish these tasks to make the App perform as I planned. The App was very time consuming with a lot of moving parts but it was interesting and I had to do a lot of research to make things work.I have the feling I can still tweak it some more but I think I will resist as in my research I have read where that is a prevailing feeling about people who do these things often that there is always more to do.
