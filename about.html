<p>My name is Patrick Harrison and I am a first  time coder. I am a retired Verizon systems technician who is starting  on the path of  starting a new career. I have decided to be a soft ware developer as it affords me the means to work from home and on the road. One happy consequence of starting on this path is that I have developed a real liking for the course material as I find it challenging  and stimulating.</p>
